# xelm

Exercism problems in Elm.

## Contributing

Here are some ideas for people wanting to write tests: 

1. Look to the haskell language track, see what tests haven't been implemented, and are appropriate for elm - 
2. Consider the elm-lang docs - what elm-specific information hasn't been included in our tests so far. 

If you want to be more generally helpful: 
1. Get it running successfully on Travis, that is worth 100 points. 


## Setup

1. Install the most recent version of Elm.
  - http://elm-lang.org/install
2. run `elm package install`

## Running Tests
1. `elm reactor`
2. `open localhost:8000`
3.  Navigate to your test file.

## Contributing Guide

Please see the [contributing guide](https://github.com/exercism/x-api/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

When adding another problem set, make sure to add the folder name to both `elm-package.json` and `config.json`.

### TODO
- [x] Put expected vs. actual results in correct order in Accumulate, Leap, and RNA tests
- [ ] Add all tests and examples
- [ ] Get running on Travis
